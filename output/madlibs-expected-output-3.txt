Your Mad Lib story:
Our American universities offer students many pretty
courses that will prepare them to become professional water bottles.
You can get a degree as a Bachelor of oranges or take a
regular liberal laptops course. Or, if you want to become
a true bright red engineer, you can study awesome mathematics
and differential paperclips. Then, after 7 years, if
you want to continue your studies you can write your couch and
become a Doctor of earrings.

When you get out into the dark world, if you have a diploma
from a university, you will be able to get the job of executive assistant easily,
or perhaps even personal trainer. If you don't have a diploma, you may have to settle
for the job title of "pinky toe".

Remember, it's important that you study hard in high school so you are able
to do well on your college entrance twigs. It is true that "a little
learning is a very plastic thing."

Please type an adjective: crafty
Please type an area of study: basket weaving

Your Mad Lib story:
Ever since he was 45, Marty has dreamed of being as evil
as his idol, Will Smith. He thinks with great terror
about having such picture-perfect eyelid(s) every day.
It's no wonder he buys his socks similar to
the one(s) seen in their films.

But he still looks way too arrogant that way, according to
most people in Sunnyvale. In fact, the Libertarians have
filed several complaints about this stinky behavior. Someone
should break the news to him, but the risk of making him feel
joy is far too great. It could ruin his status as
the 9999999'th highest rated teacher in town.
(The highest-rated is, of course, Drake.)

Did you also know that Marty also spends most of his time
at Five Guys Burgers? Perhaps he's hoping to be a ballerina
when he grows up. It's a shame he will never reach
such a/an crafty position after having majored
in the field of basket weaving.
