Your Mad Lib story:
One of the most silly characters in fiction is named
"Tarzan of the apples." Tarzan was raised by an old
frisbee and lives in the hungry jungle in the
heart of darkest San Jose. He spends most of his time
eating bees and swinging from tree to umbrella.
Whenever he gets angry, he beats on his chest and says,
"burp!" This is his war cry. Tarzan always dresses in
shiny shorts made from the skin of his jelly donut
and his best friend is the beautiful chimpanzee named
Cheetah. He is supposed to be able to speak to elephants and
spoons. In the movies, Tarzan is played by Keanu Reeves.
